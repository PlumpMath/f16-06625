* exam-2-1

change \v to v to see the equation

\(v = V_{max}C_S /(K_m + C_S)\)

\(v = V_{max}C_S /(K_m + C_S)\)

Do not worry about the units. Assume they work.

* exam-2-2

*Correction* Multiply by K_m

In \(C_S(t) = K_m W\left(\frac{S_0}{K_m} \exp\left(\frac{S_0}{K_m} - \frac{V_{max}}{K_m}t\right)\right)\) 

S_0 is the same as C_S0, the initial concentration

Deep breath.... and the next one.
