The production of propylene glycol occurs in a CSTR with a heat exchanger.

The reaction is A + B \rightarrow C
A = propylene oxide
B = water
C = propylene glycol

Initially the CSTR starts out with water in it at 75 degF in a 67 ft^3 reactor. The feed stream contains 80 lbmol/h of propylene oxide (A), 1000 lbmol of water (B) and 100 lbmol of methanol (M) which is inert.

The molar densities of each component are:
\rho_A 0.923 lbmol / ft^3
\rho_B 3.45 lbmol/ft^3
\rho_M 1.54 lbmol / ft^3
You can assume these are independent of composition and temperature

Heat exchanger data:
UA = 16000 BTU/h/degF
coolant flowrate (mc) = 1000 lbmol / hour
coolant  heat capacity = 18 BTU/lbmol/degF
coolant temperature (Ta) = 60 degF
The rate of heat transfer is given by:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
Qdot = mc * Cpb * (Ta - T) * (1 - np.exp(-UA / (mc * Cpb)))
#+END_SRC

Heat capacity data
Cpa = 35 BTU/lbmol/degF
Cpb = 18 BTU/lbmol/degF
Cpc = 46 BTU / lbmol/degF
Cpm = 19.5 BTU / lbmol/degF

The heat of reaction is -36000 BTU/lbmol A, and is assumed to be constant.

The rate constant for the reaction is:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
k = 16.96e12 * np.exp(-32400.0 / 1.987 / (T + 460.0))
#+END_SRC

The reaction is pseudo-first order in A, so -rA = k(T) C_A.

The reactants decompose if they get above 170 degF.

1. Estimate the maximum feed temperature you can use to avoid decomposition. Show a plot of the temperature vs. time.

2. *Explain qualitatively why the temperature profile looks the way it does.*

3. Estimate the exit concentration of propylene glycol for the feed temperature you found in part 1.

Here is a code block to get you started.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

from scipy.integrate import odeint
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# molar flows
Fa0 = 80.0
Fb0 = 1000.0
Fc0 = 0.0
Fm0 = 100.0

# molar densities

rhoB = 3.45
rhoM = 1.54

UA = 16000.
Ta = 60.0  # coolant T
mc = 1000.0

# Heat capacities
Cpa = 35

Hrx = -36000.0

V = 67.0   # reactor volume
Tfeed = ???
#+END_SRC


* solution

To solve this, we have to setup transient mole and energy balances and integrate them to see what the maximum temperature we achieve is. I suggest you iterate on Tfeed manually to find a value where the maximum doesn't exceed the decomposition temperature. I found a feed temperature of below 90 degrees would avoid decomposition.

*** 2. qualitative explanation

The reaction is exothermic, so as it proceeds the reactor should get hotter. Evidently, the temperature rises quickly as the concentration of A rises, and then falls. At this point, the rate of heat generation is compensated by heat transfer out of the reactor. Once the CSTR reaches steady state, the rate of heat generation and removal becomes a constant.
