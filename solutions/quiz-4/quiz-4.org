    II) CO(g) + Cl2(g) <--> COCl2 (g)	 KC = 4.57 x 10^9
Which of the following statements is correct?

[[mc:a]] Reaction I will proceed faster because KC is larger.

[[mc:b]] Reaction II will proceed faster because KC is larger.

[[mc:c]] Reaction I favors the production of products.

  :END:

Consider the following reaction:
2 NO(g)  + Cl2(g) <--> 2 NOCl(g) + heat

A flask containing NO(g), Cl2(g), and NOCl(g) is at equilibrium.  If additional NO(g) is added to the container, what happens to the system as it approaches equilibrium?

[[mc:a]] First, all of the NO  reacts and the forward reaction proceeds to completion. Then the reverse reaction occurs. 

No. The reverse reaction begins as soon as there is any product formed.

[[mc:b]] The concentrations of NO, Cl2, and NOCl fluctuate back and forth until a new equilibrium is established.

No. The reaction would proceed monotonically, not by fluctuating.

[[mc:c]] NO and Cl2 are used to make NOCl until one of the reactants runs out, limiting the production of more product.

No.

[[mc:d]] NO and Cl2 are used to make NOCl until equilibrium is established. The forward and reverse reactions continue to proceed, but the concentrations no longer vary.

[[mc:e]] The rate of the forward reaction continuously speeds up as the reaction proceeds and the rate of the reverse reaction slows down until equilibrium is reached.

Consider the following reaction:
Br2(g) + heat <--> 2 Br(g)	 KC = 1.04 x 10^{-3} at 1285C
When the reaction is cooled down to room temperature, what happens to KC?

[[mc:a]] Changing the temperature doesnâ€™t change KC

[[mc:b]] KC will decrease because of the lower temperature
The reaction is endothermic.
[[mc:c]] KC will decrease because the volume occupied by the gas becomes smaller

[[mc:d]] KC will increase because of the lower temperature.

[[mc:e]] KC will increase because the volume occupied by the gas becomes smaller

* ID:1532 Effect of Volume Change on Equilibrium
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

Consider the following reaction:
2 NO2Cl(g) --> 2NO2(g) + Cl2(g)	 KC = 0.558
If the volume of this equilibrium system is cut in half, what will happen to the equilibrium constant?

A decrease in volume increases the pressure. Since there is a mole change, the equilibrium shifts to the side with fewer moles. K will decrease.

[[mc:a]] The new KC will be larger than the original because of a temperature increase.

[[mc:b]] The new KC will be larger than the original because the reaction shifts to the left.

[[mc:c]] The new KC will be smaller than the original because of a temperature increase.

[[mc:d]] The new KC will be smaller than the original because the reaction shifts to the left.

[[mc:e]] KC will stay the same.

  :ANSWER:   c
  :END:

Once a system reaches equilibrium:

[[mc:a]] The forward and reverse reactions no longer occur.

[[mc:b]] The forward and reverse reactions continue to occur and alter the concentrations of reactants and products.

[[mc:c]] The forward and reverse reactions occur, but do not alter the concentrations of the reactants or products.

[[mc:d]]  Only the forward reaction continues to occur.

[[mc:e]]  Only the reverse reaction continues to occur.

The exothermic reaction A <--> B reaches an equilibrium conversion of 25% in an adiabatic steady state flow reactor. Which of the following will likely increase conversion?

[[mc:a]]. Add a catalyst 

[[mc:b]] Raise the inlet temperature 

[[mc:c]] Use a bigger reactor 

[[mc:d]] Add an inert to the feed 

The inert will absorb heat, and keep the temperature from increasing as much. This will allow more products to form. 

[[mc:e]] All of the above

* Changing volumetric flow
  :PROPERTIES:

  :ANSWER:   d
  :END:

The gas-phase reaction $\ce{2A -> B}$ shown below takes place in an isothermal, packed bed reactor with pressure drop. The volumetric flow rate at the reactor outlet will be ____________ at the reactor inlet.


[[mc:a]] higher than 

[[mc:b]]. lower than 

[[mc:c]] the same as 

[[mc:d]]. insufficient information 

The changing molar flow will tend to decrease the volumetric flow, but the pressure drop will increase it. There is not enough information to determine which effect dominates.
